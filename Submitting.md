## For Speakers - Submitting Materials

To submit your materials, email [speaker-files@cppcon.org](mailto:speaker-files@cppcon.org) with a link or attachment (if they are small).

If possible, please submit your slides in PDF format. This will allow the widest group of people to read them easily. You can export PDF from powerpoint and most other presentation software. You can even do it for reveal.js and reveal.md presentations as well! If you have any questions, just email [speaker-files@cppcon.org](mailto:speaker-files@cppcon.org) and ask!

For source code, a `zip` or `tar.gz` is fine. Please do not include large files, and please ensure that all files can be distributed by CppCon to the public. You may mark your code as being placed in the public domain, or include a suitable license (e.g. BSD, MIT, Boost, Apache, LGPL, or GPL). We are relying on you to ensure the code is licensed appropriately.

To help make our job easier, please name your slide files as follows:

> presentation_title__speaker_name__cppcon_2018__date

That is: title in lowercase; double underscore; speaker name in lowercase; double underscore; CppCon 2018, lowercase; double underscore; date. All spaces become underscores. Dates are in the format MonthDayYear, for example 09212018 is September 21st 2018.

Please avoid special characters in the filename, such as: `\/:*?"<>|`. For example, a hypothetical Herb Sutter plenary presentation would be named "meta_–_thoughts_on_generative_cpp_–_herb_sutter_–_cppcon_2018.pdf".

Don’t worry about the name for code archives as we will be unzipping them!
